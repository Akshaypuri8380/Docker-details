Basic Dockerfile Example

# Use an official Node runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]


Multi-stage Dockerfile Example

# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:14 as build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application (example command, adjust as needed)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the built application from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "dist/app.js"]
